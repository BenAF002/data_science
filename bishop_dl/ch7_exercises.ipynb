    "The determinant may be geometrically interpreted as the \"volume\" of a tranformation resulting from a matrix. In this case, the volume of the transformation represented by the Hessian. As the Hessian is comprised of second partial derivatives w.r.t. the parameters, it may be thought of as describing how the gradient (i.e. the first partial derivative) changes in repsonse to a change in the parameters. A *larger* determinant, therefore, suggests a larger change in the gradients due to a change in the parameters. The magnitude of this change is dictated by the variance in the input variable $\\bf x$ and the number of input observations $N$. When $\\mathbb{V}(\\bf x)$ is large, the determinant is large, indicating a steeper increase in the gradients w.r.t. changes in the parameters $w$ and $b$. This suggests that the parameters $w$ and $b$ have greater influence on the predictions. When variance is low, this influence is weaker. In the case of constant $x_n$, such that $\\mathbb{V}(\\bf x) = 0$, the determinant will be $0$, and thus the parameters $w$ and $b$ will ahve *no effect* of the loss function, and therefore no effect on the predictions. In this case, $w$ and $b$ are perfectly linearly dependent - many combinations of $w$ and $b$ can give the same predictions.\n",
