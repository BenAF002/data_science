Thus the constant term of $p$ is a zero of $p$ if and only if it is equal to $0$, and $0$ is a root of $p$ if and only if it is the constant term of $p$. So, if $0$ is a root of $p$, then it is the constant term of $p$, and it is an eigenvalue of $T$ with:\n",

    "Recall that the null space of an operator $T$ is invariant under $T$. The null space of a polynomial of $T$ is also invariant under $T$. Thus $\\text{null}\\big(T^2 + b T + cI\\big)$ is invariant under $T$. Let $U \\coloneqq \\text{null}\\big(T^2 + b T + cI\\big)$ and $S \\coloneqq T|_U$, then:\n",

    "Let $Z = \\text{span}(u, Su)$. Clearly, $Z$ is invariant under $S$. Also, $\\dim Z = 2$, because $\\dim Z$ cannot be greater than $2$, and if $\\dim Z < 2$ then $u$ would be an eigenvector of $S$ which we've shown has no eigenvectors. Then:\n",
