    "This approach is verbose but makes sense. The tough part was realizing that $w$ could be an additive inverse. I'd shown before (2A Q. 9), that $w\\in\\text{span } (v_1+w,...,v_m+w)$ when $v_1+w,...,v_m+w$ are linearly dependent. However, that proof was not biconditional, so my initial efforts that were foundation on the assumption that $v_1+w,...,v_m+w$ are linearly dependent if $w\\in\\text{span } (v_1+w,...,v_m+w)$ were fruitless. Indeed, its provable by counterexample that this isn't true.\n",
